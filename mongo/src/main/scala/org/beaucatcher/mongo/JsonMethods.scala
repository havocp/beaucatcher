/**
 * The idea of this trait is to implement a backbone.js-style set of methods
 * for a MongoDB collection. backbone.js just seems like a good "spec" for
 * a set of CRUD methods in REST format. You can pretty easily adapt this
 * to map to HTTP differently, though.
 *
 * See http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Sync
 *
 * My still-untested interpretation follows.
 *
 * CRUD maps to REST like this:
 *  create = POST   /collection
 *  read = GET   /collection[/id]
 *  update = PUT   /collection/id
 *  delete = DELETE   /collection/id
 *
 * Create and Update should return the modified fields (the fields different from those passed in)
 * though they are allowed to return unmodified fields, with an efficiency cost.
 *
 * Read should always return all fields of the object. Without the /id, it returns a JSON array of all
 * objects.
 *
 * Delete I guess should return an empty body, though I'm not sure what backbone.js expects.
 *
 * FIXME: This class probably needs some way to pass in application-specific data (such as
 * the currently-logged-in-user) to the various methods. I guess you could use thread local
 * but maybe there's something cleaner.
