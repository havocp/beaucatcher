/**
 * A DAOGroup exposes the entire chain of DAO conversions; you can "tap in" and use the
 * nicest DAO at whatever level is convenient for whatever you're doing. You can also
 * override any of the conversions as the data makes its way up from MongoDB.
 *
 * The long-term idea is to get rid of the Casbah part, and the DAOGroup will
 * have a 2x2 of DAO flavors: sync vs. async, and BObject vs. case entity.
 *
 * Rather than a bunch of annotations specifying how to go from MongoDB to
 * the case entity, there's a theory here that you can override the
 * "composer" objects and do things like validation or dealing with legacy
 * object formats in there.
